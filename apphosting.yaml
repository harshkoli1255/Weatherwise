# Settings to manage and configure a Firebase App Hosting backend.

runConfig:
  # This sets the maximum number of server instances that can run at once.
  # For the free tier, this is typically limited. Increasing this can handle more
  # concurrent traffic but may incur costs on a paid plan.
  maxInstances: 1
  
  # By default on the free tier, minInstances is 0. This means if your app
  # has no traffic, it will "scale to zero" or "go to sleep" to save resources.
  # The first request will trigger a "cold start," which may take a few seconds.
  # This is normal and ideal for cost-effective hosting.
