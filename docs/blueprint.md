# **App Name**: Weatherwise

## Core Features:

- Real-time Weather Display: Display current weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.) fetched from OpenWeather API.
- City Search: Allow users to search for weather information by city name.
- Theme Switcher: Switch between light and dark themes with a theme toggle button in the navigation bar.
- AI Weather Summary: Provide a short summary of the weather conditions using generative AI to create easy-to-understand descriptions. The summary should incorporate feels-like temperature and reasoning about whether those conditions are important; the LLM should act like a tool to decide when and if to incorporate feels-like temperature.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Sky blue (#87CEEB), representing clear skies and calmness.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F8FF), a very slightly blue tinted desaturated hue analogous to the primary color.
- Accent color: Sunny yellow (#FFD700), for highlighting important weather details, and analogous to sky blue but higher saturation and brightness.
- Headline font: 'Poppins', a geometric sans-serif for a modern and clean look.
- Body font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif offering excellent readability.
- Use clear and simple weather icons to visually represent different conditions (sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.).
- Modern, clean layout with a prominent display of current weather data. Navigation bar at the top with a theme switch button.
