## ‚ú® Core Features

*   **Dynamic Weather Dashboard:** Get real-time weather data for any city worldwide or automatically detect the user's location via browser geolocation or IP lookup.
*   **AI-Powered Insights & Search:** The application leverages Google's Gemini model via Genkit to provide users with a smarter experience:
    *   **Intelligent Search:** Simply type what you're thinking, and the AI will figure it out. It goes beyond simple city names, understanding natural language to correct typos and interpret complex queries involving landmarks, businesses, or even abbreviations. Just type your query and press Enter, or select from the smart suggestions.
        *   **Example (Abbreviations):** A search for `"VGU"` is understood as `"Vivekananda Global University, Jaipur"`.
        *   **Example (Landmarks):** A search for `"weather at the eiffel tower"` is interpreted as `"Eiffel Tower, Paris"`.
        *   **Example (Typos):** A search for `"new yrok"` is automatically corrected to `"New York"`.
    *   **Conversational Summaries:** Get friendly, easy-to-read weather summaries that highlight the most important information.
    *   **Creative Suggestions:** Receive AI-generated activity suggestions tailored to the current weather conditions.
*   **Intelligent, Customizable Alerts:**
    *   **AI-Driven Decisions:** Instead of rigid rules, the AI analyzes weather conditions to decide if an alert is significant enough to send.
    *   **Custom Schedules:** Users can define specific days and times to receive alerts, all managed within their chosen timezone.
    *   **Adjustable Sensitivity:** Control alert frequency with "Maximum," "Balanced," or "Minimal" settings to prevent notification fatigue.
    *   **Secure Cron Job Integration:** A secure webhook endpoint allows for reliable, hourly alert checks triggered by an external scheduler.
*   **Secure User Authentication:** Full sign-up, sign-in, and profile management powered by Clerk.
*   **Modern, Responsive UI:** Built with a modern, responsive UI using Tailwind CSS and ShadCN UI, featuring light and dark modes and a focus on a clean user experience.

## üß† Key Architectural Decisions

This project was designed with specific architectural patterns to ensure it is performant, resilient, and maintainable.

*   **Server-First Approach with Next.js App Router:**
    *   **Why:** By using **Server Components** and **Server Actions** as the default, we minimize the amount of JavaScript sent to the client. This results in faster initial page loads and a snappier user experience, as the heavy lifting is done on the server.
    *   **Example:** The primary `fetchWeatherAndSummaryAction` is a Server Action, allowing the client to call server-side logic without needing to define a separate API endpoint.
*   **Decoupled AI Flows for Specific Tasks:**
    *   **Why:** Instead of a single, monolithic AI prompt, the application uses smaller, specialized Genkit flows for distinct tasks like summarizing weather, deciding on alerts, and interpreting search queries. This makes the system more maintainable, testable, and allows for tailored prompts and models for each job.
    *   **How:** The `interpret-search-query` flow handles ambiguous user input. When a user types `"weather at the eiffel tower"`, the AI's job is to identify the core landmark ("Eiffel Tower") and its containing **city** ("Paris"). The application then uses the reliable city name for the API call while displaying the full, user-friendly name in the UI, ensuring both accuracy and a great user experience.
*   **Resilient, Multi-Key API Services:**
    *   **Why:** Services like OpenWeatherMap and Google Gemini often have free tiers with rate limits. To prevent a single exhausted API key from taking down the entire application, the backend services for both are designed to accept multiple API keys.
    *   **How:** If a call with one key fails due to a quota or invalid key error, the service automatically and transparently retries the request with the next available key. Failing keys are temporarily put in a "penalty box" to improve performance.
*   **Secure User Data with Clerk Private Metadata:**
    *   **Why:** A user's alert preferences (city, schedule, frequency) are sensitive and should not be stored in a place the client can easily read or manipulate, like `localStorage`.
    *   **How:** We leverage Clerk's `privateMetadata` field, a secure, server-side storage location associated with each user. This keeps their preferences safe and ensures they are only accessed and modified through secure Server Actions.
*   **Decoupled Alert Triggering with Cron Jobs:**
    *   **Why:** The system needs to check for alerts for all users every hour, regardless of whether they are using the app. Relying on client-side timers is unreliable.
    *   **How:** We expose a secure API endpoint (`/api/cron`) that is protected by a secret key. This endpoint is designed to be called by an external, reliable scheduling service (a "cron job"). This decouples the alert-checking logic from the main application's user-facing parts and ensures it runs consistently.

## ‚è∞ Setting up Automatic Hourly Alerts (Cron Job)

To enable automatic hourly alerts, you must set up a "cron job" that calls a secure API endpoint on your **deployed application**.

1.  **Set `CRON_SECRET` in your deployment environment:** Ensure you have added a secure, random `CRON_SECRET` in your Firebase project's Secret Manager.
2.  **Use a Scheduling Service:** Use a free external service like `cron-job.org` or a similar scheduler.
3.  **Configure the Job:**
    *   **URL / Endpoint:** `https://<YOUR_DEPLOYED_APP_URL>/api/cron`
    *   **Schedule:** Run **once every hour**.
    *   **HTTP Method:** `GET`
    *   **Custom Headers:** You must add an `Authorization` header with the value `Bearer <YOUR_CRON_SECRET>`.

### How to Verify Your Cron Job is Working

Check your application's logs in the Firebase Console. If you see the log message `[CRON-AUTH-SUCCESS] Cron job authorized successfully`, it's working!

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

**Will the app and alerts run 24/7 on Firebase?**

Yes. Once deployed, the app runs on Google's servers. The hourly alerts depend on the external cron job service you set up. As long as that service calls your app's `/api/cron` URL every hour, your alerts will be checked around the clock.

**If I close my computer, will the deployed app stop running?**

No. It is completely independent of your local machine.
